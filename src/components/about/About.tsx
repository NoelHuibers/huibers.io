        I am a dedicated Software Engineer based in Germany, currently pursuing
        a Master&apos;s degree in Computer Science at LMU Munich. With a
        technical foundation in TypeScript, Rust, and Python, I specialize in
        developing robust and scalable software solutions. My professional
        journey includes valuable experience at leading companies such as IABG,
        Lufthansa Technik, and TÜV Süd, where I applied my skills to real-world
        challenges. Committed to both technical excellence and innovative
        problem-solving, I am passionate about advancing the field of software
        engineering.
