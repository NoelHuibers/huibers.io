# Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my portfolio website, a dynamic and interactive platform showcasing my skills and projects. This site is built using a modern tech stack including React with Server Components and Actions, Next.js, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, shadcn, Sonner, and react-hook-form for both client and server-side validation.

## Features

- **React Server Components:** Enhances performance by allowing React components to render on the server.
- **Next.js:** Provides server-side rendering and generates static websites for faster load times.
- **TailwindCSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Framer Motion:** Used for adding intuitive animations to the UI.
- **shadcn & Sonner:** Implements advanced UI patterns and real-time features.
- **react-hook-form:** Manages form state and validation on both the client and server sides.
